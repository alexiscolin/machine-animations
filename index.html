  <h1>Machines Animation</h1>
  
  <p>This is a list of animations created for Memento SAS in order to explain their business. They are used on the the Memento App's onboarding panes.<p>
  <p>The challenge was to create animations that are smooth, easy to load and custom (colors). That's why we start using Illustrator to draw all shapes and ideas. Then, we import them inside AE application to animate and export them again to movies and json data thanks to Lottie.</p>
  <p>The concept? Delivering all pictures taken of you by photographers during an event â€” in real time using face recognition.</p>
  <p>AI + transparency (no catch with GDPR) = love that ðŸ”¥!</p>
  <p>Most interesting here was to define the integration format to deliver the best experience on all screens.</p>
